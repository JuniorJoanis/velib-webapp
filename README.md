#Velibs around you

## Overview

**velib-webapp**, is an application which enables you to see how many velibs there is available around you.
	
This is an experience how to use angularJS with leaflet map and ngresource.

I also use Nodejs and a cool framework Express as a backend. In order to have a realtime app.


## Improvement

Thanks to the Open Data more city with a bike system should be available.
