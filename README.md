#Velibs Webapp

## Overview :

**Velib-webapp** is an application which enables you to see how many velibs there is available around you.
	
This is an experience how to use angularJS with leaflet map and ngresource.

I also use Nodejs and a cool framework Express as a backend. In order to have a realtime app.

The app is deployed on heroku : [velib-webapp.com](http://stormy-anchorage-2795.herokuapp.com/)


## Improvement :

Thanks to the Open Data more city with a bike system should be available.
Install Meteor.
